Rescrobbled is a music scrobbler daemon. It detects active media players running on D-Bus using `MPRIS`, automatically updates "now playing" status, and scrobbles songs to [Last.fm](https://last.fm) or [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org) as they play.

Among other things, due to sharing a Spotify account (I know, I know), I needed a way to scrobble to Last.fm without connecting the Spotify account to my Last.fm account. Rescrobbled offers a simple solution for this.

## How to install and use

You can download one of the prebuilt binaries [here](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled/releases). The binary can be placed anywhere you like.

Rescrobbled is also available on [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rescrobbled): `cargo install rescrobbled`

Alternatively you can install from source using `cargo install --path .` from the crate root.

There is also an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rescrobbled-git/) by [brycied00d](https://github.com/brycied00d), which should always build the latest version of rescrobbled from this repository.

To use rescrobbled with Last.fm, you'll need a Last.fm API key and secret. These can be obtained [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create). To use ListenBrainz, you'll need a user token which can be found [here](https://listenbrainz.org/profile/).

### Configuration

Rescrobbled expects a configuration file at `~/.config/rescrobbled/config.toml` with the following format:
```toml
lastfm-key = "Last.fm API key"
lastfm-secret = "Last.fm API secret"
listenbrainz-token = "ListenBrainz API token"
enable-notifications = false
min-play-time = 0 # in seconds
player-whitelist = [ "Player MPRIS identity" ] # if empty or ommitted, will allow all players
filter-script = "path/to/script"
```

All settings are optional, although rescrobbled isn't very useful without Last.fm or ListenBrainz credentials. ;-)

By default, track submission respects Last.fm's recommended behavior; songs should only be scrobbled if they have been playing for at least half their duration, or for 4 minutes, whichever comes first. Using `min-play-time` you can override this.

A CLI application like `playerctl` can be used to determine a player's MPRIS identity for the whitelist. To do so start playing a song and run the following command:
```
playerctl --list-all
```

The `filter-script` will be run before submitting tracks to Last.fm and/or ListenBrainz.
It receives the artist, song title and album name on consecutive lines of its standard input
(in that order). The script should provide the filtered metadata on corresponding lines of its standard output.
This can be used to clean up song names, for example removing "remastered" and similar suffixes.
If the filter script does not return any output, the current track will be ignored.
This allows you, for example, to prevent certain tracks or artists from being scrobbled.

### Running rescrobbled

To make sure that rescrobbled can scrobble to Last.fm, you need to run the program in a terminal. This will prompt you for your Last.fm username and password, and authenticate with Last.fm. A long-lasting session token is then obtained, which will be used on subsequent runs instead of your username/password.

If you want to run rescrobbled as a daemon, you can put the provided [systemd unit file](https://github.com/InputUsername/rescrobbled/blob/master/rescrobbled.service) in the `~/.config/systemd/user/` directory.
Change `ExecStart` to point to the location of the binary, as necessary. Then, to enable the program to run at startup, use:
```
systemctl --user enable rescrobbled.service
```
You can run it in the current session using:
```
systemctl --user start rescrobbled.service
```
